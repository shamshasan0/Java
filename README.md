# ArrayList Organizer

##  Q & A 

 
- Q: Why was bubble sort used?

- A: This technique is great for swapping adjacent elements, as this is not a particularly large data set. Even if we wanted an arraylist of 100's of games, it'll still work. Bubble sort is one of the most well-known sorting techniques. Furthermore, bubble sort is the easiest to understand.

- Q: What is the purpose of a program such as this?

- A: If one was to use this program to keep track of games that they love, they could sort in other ways other than alphabetical by slightly manipulating the bubble sort conditions - yet keeping everything else the same. Anyone looking for an organizational program may find alphabetical ordered lists or other sorted lists to be of use. Keep in mind that this program is not limited to video games, but can be used to sort things of any nature, just as long as string type is preserved for string lexicographic comparisons.
