# ArrayList Organizer

##  Q & A 

 
- Q: Why was bubble sort used?

- A: The bubble sort algorithm is commonly used for comparing and swapping adjacent elements, and works well with this program - as this is not a particularly large data set. Let's say we wanted to create an arraylist of 100's of games, it'll still work. Bubble sort is one of the most well-known sorting techniques. Furthermore, bubble sort is the easiest to understand.

- Q: What is the purpose of a program such as this?

- A: If one is to use this program to keep track of games that they love, they could sort in other ways other than lexicographical by slightly manipulating the conditions in the bubble sort method - yet keeping everything else the same. Not only can you add elements of type String to the list, but you can also utilize the other methods to remove and get elements at specified positions. Anyone looking for an organizational program may find alphabetical ordered lists or other sorted lists to be of use. Keep in mind that this program is not limited to video games, but can be used to sort things of any nature, just as long as string type is preserved for string lexicographic comparisons.
